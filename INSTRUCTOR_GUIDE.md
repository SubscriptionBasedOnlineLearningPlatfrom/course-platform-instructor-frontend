## Getting Started

### Browser & device support
- **Desktop:** Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox (latest two versions) are fully supported.
- **Tablet:** Works best in landscape mode. The sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu automatically.
- **Mobile:** View-only access for dashboards; course authoring flows are optimized for screens ‚â•1024px.

### Configure the environment (dev teams)
If you run the instructor frontend locally, create a `.env` file at the project root (already git-ignored) and set:

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://course-platform-backend-ten.vercel.app
```

Restart the dev server after changes. All authenticated API calls depend on this value‚Äîmisconfiguration leads to `401` or CORS errors.

### Creating or accessing your account
1. Navigate to `/login` or click **Login** in the sidebar.
2. Pick **Sign Up** to create an instructor account:
   - Provide username, email, password (confirmation required).
   - Successful registration automatically stores your JWT and redirects to the dashboard.
3. Prefer to sign in with Google? Click **Continue with Google**‚Äîon success the backend redirects back with `token` and a serialized `user` payload embedded in the URL. The app saves both to `localStorage` and removes the query parameters.
4. Existing users choose **Sign In** and enter email/password.

> **Password reset:** From the login tab click **Forgot password?**. If an email is filled in, a reset link is requested through `/auth/reset-password`.

### Understanding authentication & sessions
- Tokens are stored in `localStorage` under the `token` key alongside a `user` object. Closing the browser keeps you logged in until the JWT expires.
- Logging out clears `token`, `user`, and cached `instructorProfileImages`, emits a storage event, and refreshes the app state across tabs.
- Guest users (no token) can browse the dashboard in read-only mode, but protected routes redirect to `/login`.

## Navigating the Interface

### Dashboard
Once logged in, the **Dashboard** ( `/dashboard` ) becomes your home screen:
- **Profile Card:** Quick glance at name, role, and shortcuts to update profile info.
- **Course Overview:** Lists your courses (title, category, status). Use **Create Course** shortcut from here.
- **Learner Feedback Carousel:** Rotating testimonials to keep engagement insights top-of-mind.
- Guest users see a promotional banner encouraging them to sign in.

### Sidebar & layout
- Permanent on desktop; collapsible on small screens via the hamburger icon.
- Key links for instructors:
  - **Dashboard** ‚Äì overview page.
  - **My Profile** ‚Äì edit personal details.
  - **Course Management** ‚Äì expands to *Add Course* and *Course List*.
  - **Show Enrolled Students** ‚Äì enrollment analytics.
  - **Comments & Replies** ‚Äì respond to learner discussions.
  - **Learner Feedback** ‚Äì direct link to carousel content.
- Footer button toggles between **Login** and **Sign Out** depending on session state.

### Toasts & alerts
- Course creation, quiz actions, and many API interactions surface immediate feedback via toast notifications (`sonner` / `react-toastify`). Read them‚Äîthey include validation errors and success confirmations.

## Profile & Identity

### Editing your profile
1. Go to **My Profile** (`/profile`).
2. Click **Edit Profile** to unlock the form.
3. Required fields: **Full Name** and **Email**.
4. Optional fields: phone, website, portfolio, Instagram handle, bio, expertise tags (comma-separated).
5. Save updates to persist them via `PUT /instructor/profile/`. The app also syncs the `user` object in `localStorage`.

### Updating the profile photo
- Within edit mode, the **Profile Image** section provides an uploader (`ProfileImageUpload`).
- Images upload through the backend‚Äôs media pipeline; successful uploads immediately refresh the displayed avatar.

### Changing your password
- Navigate to **Update Password** (`/update-password`) from the sidebar or route list.
- Follow the on-screen form. (The flow interacts with `/auth/change-password` on the backend.)

## Course Lifecycle

### Creating a course
Access **Add Course** via the sidebar or **Create Course** button on the dashboard.

Fields & actions in the form:
1. **Course Title** ‚Äì required.
2. **Category** ‚Äì select from programming, design, business, language.
3. **Description** ‚Äì at least 10 characters.
4. **Difficulty Level** ‚Äì Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced.
5. **Duration (hours)** ‚Äì optional numeric input.
6. **Requirements** ‚Äì optional text area for prerequisites.
7. **Thumbnail Upload** ‚Äì supports JPG/PNG up to 5‚ÄØMB. Drag-and-drop or click to select, with preview & remove actions.

On submission the UI:
- Converts the form into `FormData` so the thumbnail travels with the request.
- Sends a `POST /instructor/courses` request with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Displays success toast and reroutes to **Course List** (`/view-courses`).

> **Tip:** If you see ‚ÄúPlease login first,‚Äù your token is missing/expired‚Äîlog in again and retry.

### Viewing & editing existing courses
- **Course List** (`/courses` or `/view-courses`): interactive cards with view/edit actions.
- **Dashboard ‚Üí Your Courses** also lists summaries. Click **View** to inspect details at route `/courses/:courseId`.
- Editing uses the same API (`PUT /instructor/courses/:courseId`). Make sure to re-upload thumbnails if you want to replace them.

### Curriculum builder (modules & chapters)
Open **Curriculum** via `/courses/:courseId/curriculum`:
1. **Add Module** ‚Äì provide a module name, click **Add Module**. Modules render as expandable panels.
2. **Add Chapter** ‚Äì inside a module, type a lesson title and click **Add Chapter**. Each chapter becomes a row.
3. **Reopen modules** by clicking the header chevrons.
4. **Delete** modules or chapters using the trash icon‚Äîconfirmation dialogs protect against accidental removal.

The page reads data from `GET /instructor/modules/:courseId` and updates via `POST`/`DELETE` endpoints (`APIContext`).

### Uploading learning materials
Within each chapter card you can attach resources:
- **Add Video** (`POST /instructor/chapters/:lessonId/video`)
- **Add Note** (`POST /instructor/chapters/:lessonId/note`)
- **Add Assignment** (`POST /instructor/chapters/:lessonId/assignment`)

All three open a system file picker and upload via `FormData`. The buttons gray out once a resource exists‚Äîdelete it to re-upload.

### Managing quizzes
1. From a chapter card, click **Add Quiz** to open `/create-quiz/:lessonId`.
2. Enter a **Quiz Title**, draft questions, supply answer options (‚â•2), select the correct option, and click **Add Question to List**.
3. Repeat for multiple questions. Use the ‚ÄúüóëÔ∏è‚Äù icon to remove answers or entire questions.
4. Save with **Save Quiz** (`POST /instructor/quizzes/create/:lessonId`).
5. Already have a quiz? Use **Edit Quiz** to jump to `/edit-quiz/:lessonId/:quizId`.
6. **Export** (JSON download) and **Import** (JSON upload) let you reuse quiz templates.

### Deleting courses, modules, or chapters
- Deleting a **module** triggers `DELETE /instructor/modules/:moduleId` and removes all attached chapters.
- Deleting a **chapter** hits `DELETE /instructor/chapters/:lessonId` and clears associated resources/quizzes (confirm in prompt).
- Deleting an entire **course** uses `DELETE /instructor/courses/:courseId` and cascades through related content. Ensure you really want to remove it before confirming.

## Learner Management

### Enrollment overview
Visit `/EnrollmentOverview` to inspect enrollment analytics:
- Search bar filters by student name.
- Table (desktop) or cards (mobile) show **Total Enrollments**, **Completion Rate**, and **Certificates Issued** per learner.
- Data source: `GET /instructor/overview/enrollment` (requires valid token).

### Grading student submissions
1. From the curriculum page, click **View Student Submissions** (button at top right) or manually open `/courses/:courseId/submissions`.
2. The table lists each submission with student name, file reference, and editable grade field.
3. Enter grades (0‚Äì100 scale recommended) and click **Save** per row. Under the hood this calls `PATCH /instructor/submissions/:submissionId/grade`.
4. Pagination arrows move between pages of submissions (4 per page).

### Managing comments & replies
The **Comments & Replies** page (`/CommentsReplies`) allows you to:
- Search by learner name, course title, or comment text.
- Expand comments to show/hide replies.
- Respond inline: type your message and hit **Submit** (`POST /instructor/comments/:commentId/replies`).
- Edit replies (`PUT /instructor/comments/update-reply/:replyId`) or delete them (`DELETE /instructor/comments/delete-reply/:replyId`).
- Toasts confirm each action or warn on failure.

### Learner feedback carousel
The feedback carousel (dashboard and `/learner`) rotates testimonials. Use it during presentations or to review qualitative feedback trends.

## Shortcuts, Tips & Best Practices
- **Re-auth quickly:** If navigations suddenly redirect to `/login`, press ‚åò+Shift+R (hard refresh) to wipe cached tokens, then sign in.
- **Thumbnail optimization:** Images ‚â•1920px convert to CDN-friendly formats. Prefer 16:9 aspect ratios for best card previews.
- **Module planning:** Create all modules first, then add chapters. Each module collapses so large courses stay manageable.
- **Quiz drafts:** The builder stores drafts in `localStorage` (`quizCreatorData`) until you clear them or submit, preventing accidental data loss.
- **Export quizzes before editing:** In case you need to revert to an earlier version, export the quiz JSON prior to large edits.
- **Use the enrollment search:** Type part of a name to quickly jump to specific learners.
- **Keep replies professional:** Replies surface to students immediately; edits and deletes are logged server-side.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQs

**I keep seeing ‚ÄúUnauthorized‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo authentication token found.‚Äù**
- Your session expired. Sign out (if possible), refresh the page, and log in again. Ensure `localStorage` isn‚Äôt blocked in your browser.

**Course creation fails with ‚ÄúFailed to create course.‚Äù**
- Check that your backend URL is correct and reachable.
- Confirm the thumbnail is smaller than 5‚ÄØMB and a valid image.
- Inspect the toast message; backend validation errors are forwarded to you.

**Uploads or quiz saves hang indefinitely.**
- Network issues can interfere with `FormData` requests. Retry on a stable connection.
- Opening the browser console (‚å•‚åòI / F12) shows detailed error logs from the API helpers.

**Enrollment table is empty.**
- No enrollments exist yet, or your token lacks instructor privileges. Verify with an admin.

**Google login returns me to the login page.**
- The backend must whitelist your frontend domain. Confirm `ADMIN_FRONTEND_URL` or `INSTRUCTOR_FRONTEND_URL` is set server-side and redeploy.

**Where are files stored?**
- Media uploads leverage the backend‚Äôs integration with DigitalOcean Spaces. Uploaded filenames are normalized; the UI displays human-readable names by trimming generated prefixes.
